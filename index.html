            <section>
                <span class="text-impact">Nikola Tesla</span> was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, to an ethnic 
                Serbian family. His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox
                    priest, and his mother, Đuka Mandić, was talented in making home
                    tools and memorizing Serbian epic poems. Tesla was the fourth of
                    five children, having three sisters and an older brother who 
                    died in a horseback riding accident at the age of five.

                Growing up, Tesla attended primary and secondary school in Smiljan
                    and Karlovac, where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. 
                    It was in high school where he became particularly interested in 
                    electricity through demonstrations by his physics professor.
                    Tesla demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics, performing 
                    integral calculus in his head which led his teachers to suspect
                    him of cheating. He graduated high school in 1873, completing 
                    the four-year term in three years.

                Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his 
                mother's genetics and influence. He would often reflect on his 
                Serbian heritage and his father's profession as a priest as 
                inspiration in his views on science and technology.

                    <h4>(AC) electricity system</h4>
                    <p>He is best known for his contributions to the design of the 
                        alternating current (AC) electricity system, which is the 
                        predominant electrical system used in the world today. His 
                        work on AC power allowed for the efficient transmission of
                         electrical energy over long distances, making the widespread 
                         use of electricity possible.</p>

                    <h4>Tesla coil</h4>
                    <p>One of his most famous work is arguably his development of the Tesla 
                        coil, a high-frequency transformer that is capable of generating 
                        extremely high voltages. The Tesla coil was used in a variety of
                         applications, including wireless communication and the creation 
                         of artificial lightning. It is considered one of the most 
                         significant inventions in electrical engineering.</p>

                    <h4>Wireless energy</h4>
                    <p>Another notable work of Tesla is his research on wireless energy
                         transmission. He believed that electricity could be transmitted 
                         wirelessly, without the need for physical connections. He 
                         demonstrated this concept in 1899 with his "Tesla coil" 
                         transmitter and "Tesla coil" receiver. This concept has been the
                          foundation of wireless communication and has contributed to the
                           development of technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>

                        <p>  He was born in the

                             <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Orthodox_Church" target="_blank">Orthodox Priest</a></span>. Milutin was known for being an intelligent
                              and hard-working man, who instilled a love of learning in 
                              his children. He is credited with being a major influence
                               in Nikola's life and his decision to become an inventor 
                               and engineer. He passed away in 1879, when Nikola was still
                                a student. Despite his passing, Milutin Tesla's legacy 
                                lived on through his son's numerous groundbreaking 
                                inventions and contributions to the field of electrical

                              was also deeply religious and instilled strong moral values
                               in her children. Georgina was known for being an important
                                figure in the life of her son, Nikola Tesla, and was a 
                                source of support and encouragement for him throughout his 
                                life. Despite her relatively simple life, she played a 
                                significant role in the upbringing of her famous son and
